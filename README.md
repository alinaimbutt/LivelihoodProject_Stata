# LivelihoodProject_Stata
Data analysis for a project involving a survey on livelihoods
Hereâ€™s a summary of what the script does:

**Environment Setup:**

Clears any existing data and settings.
Sets memory allocation and the maximum number of variables.
Defines global variables for the directory and data file path.
Changes the working directory to the specified path and loads the data file.

**Data Preparation:**

Installs the tabout package for advanced tabulation.
Removes records where the survey was partially completed or refused.
Renames and formats a variable as the household ID.
Drops incomplete and unnecessary data based on survey completion status.

**Descriptive Analysis:**

Various demographic and socio-economic characteristics are analyzed and visualized, including marital status, primary language, and ethnicity of the household head, as well as the sector of employment.
Tables and graphs (histogram, pie, bar) are used to display the distribution and relationships among these variables.

**Survey Response Cleaning and Manipulation:**

Missing values and label assignments are managed.
String variables are converted to numeric where appropriate.
Generates new variables to capture specific characteristics like relationship to household head, marital status, gender, and educational background of survey respondents.

**Detailed Analysis Sections:**

Section 1 and Section 2 include deeper analyses of individual and household attributes, focusing on employment, skills, education, gender, and age. This includes generating new variables, labeling, and tabulating data to summarize information on various aspects like employment status, types of work, and training needs.
Detailed cross-tabulations explore the interplay between different demographic factors and survey responses.

**Final Output:**

The final analysis is prepared for 561 out of 577 surveys.
The results are used to understand the demographic and socio-economic landscape of the surveyed population, with potential implications for policy and program development focused on improving livelihoods.

**Comments and Documentation:**

The script includes comments that explain each step, which is crucial for maintaining the code, making updates, and understanding the flow of data analysis.
Overall, this Stata script is a thorough exploration of survey data intended to provide insights into the socio-economic conditions of a specific population, with the goal of informing decisions on development and support strategies.
